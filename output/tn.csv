"Heritage Grade-I comprise
of buildings, and precincts
of national or historical
importance, embodying
excellence in architectural
style, design, technology
and material usage. They
may be associated with a

representative of lifestyle of a
particular community or region
and may, also be distinguished
by setting on a street line, or
special character of the façade
and uniformity of height width
and scale."
